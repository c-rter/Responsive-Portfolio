      <p id="firstblurb">I am an aspiring developer interested in working with VR and AR app development. 
        I find it obnoxious when people say "I'm a creative", but I sure do love that kind of stuff.
        I am a U of T alum with professional exprience in graphic design, copywriting, branding, photography, and music composition.
        My last four years have been spent honing my craft downtown for a large real estate company as a one man multi-media marketing department, which I continue to do daily.
        </p><p id="secondblurb">
        For a long time I did not see coding as particularly creative, but when I tried VR I realized how wrong I was.
        VR (and coding in general) is the ultimate creative medium with endless control!
        The capable artist is now able create entire worlds, complete with custom narrative directions,
        visual and spatial identities, soundtracks, physics engines, tactile interaction, the list goes on. The possibilites are exciting,
        endless, maybe even a little disconcerting. Sign me up...
